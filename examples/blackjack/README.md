## Decentralized Blackjack on Reach
This projects shows how to have a decentralized version of blackjack on the blockchain.

# Description
Currently, this version of blackjack just has two players - Alice and Bob, who make decisions like they are the house - if I'm at 16 or under, I hit, if higher, I stay or I busted. Nobody hits if one of them started with blackjack. The scores are then calculated and the winner is paid.

# How to run
Simply run `./reach run` and it should play through the game.

# Future editions
Future editions will be playable where you can make decisions as both Alice and Bob. The starting hand is currently created on the frontend, as randomness is very hard on the blockchain, but that is something that will hopefully change in the future.
