Participant is a user in your program. In the RPS tutorial Alice and Bob are both participants. They are individual actors who can have unique functionality in the program. 
A ParticipantClass is a class of participants. This is a class, or a grouping, of users who hold the same functionality. 
However, instead of using ParticipantClass we should use API. 
API is like ParticipantClass in that it’s a class of users with the same functionality, but an API allows the front end to communicate with the DApp as needed.
There is an example of API in use here
